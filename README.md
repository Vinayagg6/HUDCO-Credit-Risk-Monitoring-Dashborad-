# HUDCO-Credit-Risk-Monitoring-Dashborad-
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard developed for HUDCO (Housing and Urban Development Corporation Ltd.) to monitor and analyze loan exposure data. The dashboard focuses on tracking the total principal outstanding amount distributed across various sectors, security types, and borrower classifications (Government or Private), with stage-wise segmentation of loan performance.

Objective:
The main objective of this dashboard is to help the credit risk and finance teams at HUDCO visualize trends and changes in loan exposure on a quarterly basis. It allows users to identify increases or decreases in outstanding principal amounts, helping in better risk assessment and decision-making.

Key Features:

Provides filters for Sector, Scheme, Security Type, and Borrower Type (Govt/Pvt).

Displays stage-wise categorization of accounts (SMA0, SMA1, SMA2, SMA3) based on their repayment status.

Highlights top borrowers with the highest principal outstanding amounts.

Offers a sector-wise summary with stage classification to monitor risk concentration.

Interactive visuals and KPIs make it easy to analyze data for over 2900+ borrowers.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Power BI for building the dashboard and visuals.

Microsoft Excel for initial data preparation and transformation.

DAX for creating custom measures and calculated columns in Power BI.

Impact:
The dashboard allows HUDCOâ€™s teams to gain a clear understanding of loan performance and risk exposure. It supports strategic decision-making in credit monitoring, fund allocation, and borrower engagement.

Note:
The data used in this project is either publicly available or anonymized to ensure confidentiality.
